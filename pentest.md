### Pentdocks :-- Web application pentesting tools for docker.
```
Pentdocks:-- Web application pentesting tools for docker.
Usually, people who have one laptop face problems when multitasking. While pentesting, 
I used to install and run VMware in ubuntu to run other tools to finish my work faster. 
So i found a way to solve this using docker and I fell in love with it. 
The most amazing thing that i'm fascinated about is that the docker is just like an OS, internally running. 
You can keep backups using sudo docker save os:latest > os.tar and many more. just try it, you will love it.
