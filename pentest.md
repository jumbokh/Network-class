collected in one place. List types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data patterns, fuzzing payloads, web shells, 
and many more. The goal is to enable a security tester to pull this repository onto a new testing box and have access to every 
type of list that may be needed.

### toxssin -- open-source penetration testing tool 
* https://github.com/t3l3machus/toxssin
```
toxssin is an open-source penetration testing tool that automates the process of exploiting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
It consists of an https server that works as an interpreter for the traffic generated by the malicious JavaScript payload that powers this tool (toxin.js).

This project started as (and still is) a research-based creative endeavor to explore the exploitability depth that an XSS vulnerability 
may introduce by using vanilla JavaScript, trusted certificates and cheap tricks.

### Pentdocks :-- Web application pentesting tools for docker.
```
Pentdocks:-- Web application pentesting tools for docker.
Usually, people who have one laptop face problems when multitasking. While pentesting, 
I used to install and run VMware in ubuntu to run other tools to finish my work faster. 
So i found a way to solve this using docker and I fell in love with it. 
The most amazing thing that i'm fascinated about is that the docker is just like an OS, internally running. 
You can keep backups using sudo docker save os:latest > os.tar and many more. just try it, you will love it.
