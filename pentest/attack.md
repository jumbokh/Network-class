PREREQUISITES BEFORE INSTALLING:
1.Linux or MacOS. (Not working on windows)
2.Python 3.7+
Installing instructions:
❗Note: Don't install QRLJacker and Firefox as root in a regular user's session because it's not supported by Firefox which would give error on running modules in framework.❗
Important note: If you have multiple python version, use python3.7 command instead of python3 in the following steps and use python3.7 -m pip instead of pip, pip3 or even python3 -m pip because that's the reason of 95% of the issues opened here. I think people often skip the important parts 😄
1.Update Firefox browser to the latest version
2. Install the latest geckodriver from https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases and extract the file then do :
chmod +x geckodriver
sudo mv -f geckodriver /usr/local/share/geckodriver
sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/geckodriver /usr/local/bin/geckodriver
sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/geckodriver /usr/bin/geckodriver
3. Clone the repo with git clone https://github.com/OWASP/QRLJacking
then do  cd QRLJacking/QRLJacker
4. Install all the requirements with pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Now you can run the framework with python3 QrlJacker.py --help
