Social Engineering
( The art of Human hacking )
This is one of the most favourite topic of mine.
Although you have a great knowledge about the hacking tools but Social Engineering Techniques is what you need to know to perform hacking.
Its my topic which I am gonna focusing on and already uploaded some ( payload ) videos on it..
I will say its a technique of manipulation. If you master this, You can get all into your favour.
Hacking a human mind is what you need to learn at first.
As this topic is really vast and there is no any end of this like a human wants. But still I will try to explain the steps of this technique. 
Its the steps of ethical hacking with social engineering according to me... 
Steps of ethical hacking
- Information Gathering
- Scanning and Analysing 
( Social Engineering )
- Exploting
- Maintaining Acess
- Performing our aim
- Clearing logs
- Exiting
( Social Engineering )
- This is the part where you need to use your technique of human hacking to manuplate them and get all into your favour. There are lots of ways to manuplate a human mind based on their basis of manipulation to do something in your favour.
Basis of manipulation...
- Information ( Name, Numbers, Parents, Device, Timing etc )
- Interest ( Games, social medias, hobbies, etc )
- Psychology ( Behaviour, attitude, etc )
There types of basis can be used to perform social engineering techniques. There are lot more to share but I can't cause i am tired of typing haha but hope so it will be useful for you♥︎. THANKYOU

### trape (stable) v2.0
* git clone https://github.com/jofpin/trape.git
```
Trape is an OSINT analysis and research tool, which allows people to track and execute intelligent social engineering attacks in real time. It was created with the aim of teaching the world how large Internet companies could obtain confidential information such as the status of sessions of their websites or services and control their users through their browser, without their knowledge, but It evolved with the aim of helping government organizations, companies and researchers to track the cyber criminals.
How to use it
First unload the tool.
git clone https://github.com/jofpin/trape.git
cd trape
python3 trape.py -h
If it does not work, try to install all the libraries that are located in the file requirements.txt
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Example of execution
Example: python3 trape.py --url http://example.com --port 8080
If you face some problems installing the tool, it is probably due to Python versions conflicts, you should run a Python 2.7 environment :
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 trape_env
source trape_env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 trape.py -h
