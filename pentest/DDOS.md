DDoS-Ripper:-- DDos Ripper a Distributable Denied-of-Service (#DDOS) attack server that cuts off-targets or surrounding infrastructure in a flood of Internet traffic.
DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness using multiple compromised computer systems as a source of attack traffic. Search engines may include computers and other #network resources such as IoT devices. From a higher level, the DDOS attack is like an unexpected traffic jam stuck on a highway, preventing regular traffic from reaching its destination.

### Unbekannt Framework 6.0:-- A Hacking and PentestingTool for Linux and Windows.
```
Info
The Linux version is no longer supported! The last Linux version is 6.0 that you find inside this repository. The reason for this is that the Unbekannt Framework originally existed for Windows and Linux only supports a few features. Thats why I decided not to release new versions for Linux anymore.
